# Challenge 1- Dark Matter

# OPERA

- Detector composed of scintillator and Pb
    - Scintillator is Photoemulsion

# Dark Matter

- $\nu\_{e}$ interacting with atomic electron looks similar to DM interaction.
    - It leaves an EM shower

## SHiP

- Investigating this approach (?)
- Similar approach will be used as OPERA (ie photoemulsion)

# Data Structure

## basetrack

Has x,y,z, TX, TY (angles), chi2 (track quality)

# General information

Hosted on Kaggle

Deadline is on Wed 11:50 pm
