# Decomposition and Embedding

We will have a glimpse of unsupervised learning in this lecture

### Embeddings

Instead of linear transformation, use dictionary

### Multi-dimensional scaling

- Measure distance between higher dimensional data and in new lower dimensional space
    - Then transform such that distance is minimized somehow
    - Details are unclear currently.
